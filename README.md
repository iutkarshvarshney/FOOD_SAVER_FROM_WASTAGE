A food donation Android application serves as a vital tool in the fight against food waste and hunger. By creating a seamless platform that connects individuals, restaurants, supermarkets, and other food businesses with surplus food to charities, food banks, and shelters, the app ensures that excess food reaches those who need it most instead of ending up in landfills.
